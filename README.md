# Product-catalogue
  This page shows the public product catalogue from the backend. When the page loads, it calls /catalogue to get all published products and displays them as cards with image, name, and price. If stock is zero, it shows “Out of Stock.” The layout is simple, responsive, and helps verify that your backend API is working correctly.
